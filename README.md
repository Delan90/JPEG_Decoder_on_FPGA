The code is working on the [Compsoc platform](http://compsoc.eu/)

The reason choose this paltform is:

Has all the ingredients of modern systems on chip
– Multiple processors
– Direct memory access (DMA) coprocessors
– Heterogeneous distributed shared memory hierarchy
– Network on chip with heterogeneous communication characteristics – Memory-mapped I/O

The design details can be found on the [project report](https://github.com/Delan90/JPEG_Decoder_on_FPGA/blob/master/5KK03%20-%20Group%201%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf)
